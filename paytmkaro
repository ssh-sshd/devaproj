branching stratagy

we follow two different branching stratagy one is master branch and another is Development branch it is very simple. Once developer pushes all his code to the development brach we take that perticular code and through CI/CD pipeline we automate everything like we generate the artifacts we first deploy on dev environment servers once we get a signoff mail from dev environement servers and then we build this perticular project in UIT, TEST and  QA environment servers and i deploy on perticular environments for testing purpose so that testers will work on that deploument once we get a singoff mail from testing team then we merge that perticular development branch with master branch and in that master branch we will get a clean code so from master branch we build a perticular job and we deploy in that pre-prod environment
